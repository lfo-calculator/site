# Hawaii Legal Notes

## Overview

This document outlines the key considerations and structures necessary to provide proper responses and calculations of potential sentencing obligations. The intent is to inform the software and algorithms invoked to respond to inquiries about sentencing options.

To simplify development and rollout, the initial focus will be on traffic infractions. They are a complex structure in and of themselves, and constitute a significant percentage of court activity and LFO sentencing.

## District Courts

District courts handle the vast majority of LFO cases. District courts are courts within Hawaii's five circuit courts.
