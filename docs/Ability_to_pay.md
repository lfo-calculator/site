# Determining "Ability to Pay"

A defendant's *ability to pay* should be a considered in all sentences involving Legal Financial Obligations (LFOs). Many circumstances or conditions contribute to an ability to pay determination, but sentencing considerations are principally determined by

* Whether a defendant receives services that satisfy an *indigency* determination
* Financial condition and supporting documentation that demonstrate fines and fees above a certain level would be overly onerous
