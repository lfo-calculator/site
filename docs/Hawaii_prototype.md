# The Hawaii LFO Calculator Prototype

## Notes

Several things that might help looking through the statutes:

1. Fee statutes: You probably noticed that the seatbelt law explicitly states the fine but not the fees. Fees are generally distributed elsewhere in the statutes (it's an understatement to say laws relating to LFOs are a messy network). I'm attaching two tables, one for criminal (T1_T7 REV_5_15 CHEAT SHEET.xlsx) and one for non-crim (i.e., traffic infractions and non-traffic violations; D1_D7 REV_5_15 CHEAT SHEET.xlsx), that list fees and their authorizing statutes. This list is not exhaustive and now a few years old, but for an initial test focused on the common traffic list, it should point you to the applicable fees.

2. Fines listed in a general penalty statute: Unlike the seatbelt law, other laws don't always state the amount of the fine. Instead there is a "penalty" section somewhere else in the chapter, and it defines a fine or range of fines for offenses within that chapter. Just a heads up if testing other offenses from the list.

3. Default fines: Even though a range of fines can be assessed for some traffic infractions, in practice a default fine is used (which falls somewhere within the range). The default fines comes from a "fine schedule," which is a table available to judges in traffic court. The schedule will be needed down the road, but I wanted to put it on your radar now in case you stumble upon traffic laws where a default fine is provided in the common traffic list but you don't see it in the statutes.
